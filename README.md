**📊 Financial Analysis Dashboard — Power BI**

📝 **Overview**

This project presents an interactive Financial Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI to analyse sales performance, gross margins, departmental trends, and YoY growth across multiple years. The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly understand their financial health and uncover valuable insights for strategic planning.

🎯 **Project Objective**

The objective of this project is to consolidate raw financial data into a dynamic reporting tool that:

•	Evaluates company-wide sales and margin performance.

•	Highlights top and bottom-performing product categories.

•	Tracks YoY trends across states, departments, and store types.

•	Supports data-driven decision-making with interactive visuals.

•	Simplifies reporting and reduces manual data analysis time.

**🧩 Problem Statement**

The company lacked a centralised and automated way to analyse financial performance. Reporting was manual, fragmented, and limited, making it difficult for stakeholders to identify trends, compare results, or understand the key drivers behind performance changes. A unified dashboard was needed to bring clarity, speed, and insight to the decision-making process.


**❓Research Questions**

This dashboard was developed to answer critical business questions, including:


**Sales & Performance**

•	How do total sales, target sales, and gross margins trend across multiple years?

•	Which states generate the highest revenue?

•	How do store types (Core, Digital, Local) differ in performance?


**Department & Product Insights**

•	Which product categories and departments drive the most revenue?

•	Which products are underperforming or declining YoY?

•	How does each department contribute to overall financial growth?


**Cost & Margin Analysis**

•	What is the YoY trend in cost of sales?

•	Which departments maintain the strongest margins?


**🔍 Insights**

Key insights identified from the dashboard include:

•	Total Sales reached $1.39bn, delivering a +4.17% YoY increase

•	Gross Margin climbed to $765M, a +6.11% YoY improvement

•	Texas ranked as the top-performing state by revenue

•	High-performing departments include Clothing, Garage, and Other

•	Top-selling products included Accessories (Clothing) and Bicycle Storage (Garage)

•	Underperforming categories included Projectors, certain Kitchen items, and miscellaneous product lines

•	Sales consistently exceeded targets, indicating strong operational performance

•	Slicers enabled drilldowns by Year, Store Type, and Department for deeper exploration


**📌 Recommendations**

Based on the findings from this analysis:

•	Invest more in high-performing regions — especially Texas — to capture additional market share

•	Refine product strategy by expanding inventory in best-selling categories and optimising or discontinuing low performers

•	Focus marketing campaigns on the Clothing and Garage departments due to strong YoY growth

•	Review cost structures in underperforming product lines to improve margins

•	Enhance operational reporting by integrating forecasting and inventory analytics into future dashboards

•	Automate refresh schedules in Power BI for seamless, real-time performance insights


**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

•	Power BI Desktop

•	Power Query

•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

•	Excel / CSV Data Sources
